# Learning_Projects

This repository is created in the endeavour to learn, practice, and apply several methods and algorithms existing in rising Machine Learning, Analytics, and AI domain, including Reinforcement Learning, LSTM, et cetera, from several resources.

The resources include tutorial websites, video links, other git repositories by advanced users and algorithm inventors are explored, worked on, and studied.

Links to theories and relevant blogs to understand the concepts also collated.

Further in depth study and work to be done, along with improvements  and augmentations on existing ones.
