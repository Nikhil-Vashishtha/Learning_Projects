# Learning_Projects

This repository is created in the endeavour to learn, practice, and apply several methods and algorithms existing in rising Deep Learning and AI domain, including Reinforcement Learning, LSTM, GAN, et cetera, from several resources.

The resources include tutorial websites, video links, other git repositories by advanced users and algorithm inventors are explored, worked on, and studied.

Links to theories and relevant blogs to understand the concepts also collated.

Further in depth study and work to be done, along with improvements  and augmentations on existing ones.

LSTM_RNNs: This project explores text generator in tensorflow and logging and hyperparameters were stored in database separately for further analysis.

reinforcementLearnings: This project replicates frozen lake game and cart-pole apparatus to study the theory and experiment the code on Reinforcement Learning.

name_identifier: This project is fully owned experiment done on data got on the list of names, to create a model to predict if a given word is a valid name or not.
